  <h2>What is CARK?</h2>
  <p>
    CARK stands for "Campuran Merk" or "Mixed Brands." It is a coloring technique that blends various brands of colored pencils to achieve a rich and realistic finish. This approach embraces the strengths of each brand, using them for different purposes like blending, contrast, and texture.

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    Born out of necessity and limited tools, the CARK technique was developed through creative problem-solving. It proves that unique and beautiful results can come from combining what we already have.
  </p>

  <h2>Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    CARK is more than just a technique. It carries a message: no matter your tools, you can create something extraordinary through persistence and passion. Every pencil, no matter the brand, has value.
